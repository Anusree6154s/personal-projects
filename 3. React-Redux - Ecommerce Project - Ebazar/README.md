For a deployed and hosted eCommerce application, your README should focus on providing users and potential contributors with the necessary information to understand, interact with, and potentially contribute to the application. Here's a streamlined version focusing on the aspects relevant to a live application:


## cookies and running sever+client on same url
- we can run server and client on diff urls. but if we want to pass cookies from server to client andn the n read from client to server without involving client ni it, we need to create a build folder of client and read it from the server url itsel. means we need to run both client ans server on same url.
- another way to pass toknes without cookies an dseperately deploying client and server is by passng token in authorization header from client to server and then reading from there in server side.
